  Hi there. I’m Alexi, a Computer Science student who enjoys building things,
  tinkering with code, and sometimes stumbling into bugs I probably wasn’t
  supposed to find. I’ve been meaning to start a blog for a while now, mostly to
  have a space where I can share the things I’m learning, building, and
  occasionally breaking (in good faith, of course).

Hi there. I’m **Alexi**, a Computer Science student who enjoys building things, tinkering with code, and sometimes stumbling into bugs I probably wasn’t supposed to find. I’ve been meaning to start a blog for a while now, mostly to have a space where I can share the things I’m learning, building, and occasionally breaking (in good faith, of course).

Here’s what you can expect to see here:

- Projects I’m working on, whether it’s a tool to help students or just something random I thought would be fun to build
- Stories from finding bugs or vulnerabilities, and what happens after reporting them
- Writeups and walkthroughs that I hope can help someone else out there
- Some personal reflections too — things I’m figuring out as I go through college and tech life

If you’re curious, here are a few projects I’ve worked on so far:

- [**ADMU Tuition Fee Viewer**](https://tuition.alexi.life) – A quick way to check your tuition fees without digging through PDFs
- [**ADMU QPI Calculator**](https://qpi.alexi.life) – Helps Ateneo students compute their QPI faster!
- [**My personal site**](https://alexi.life) – Everything else about me in one place, you’re on it right now!

I don’t have everything figured out, but I enjoy learning and sharing along the way. If even one post here helps someone else or sparks an idea, I’d be happy.

Thanks for stopping by. I’ll be posting soon.

— **Alexi**
