## Overview

Building a platform to help students discover and apply to internships and opportunities that match their interests and skills. Currently in active development as a side project while learning product thinking and full-stack development.

## The Problem



As a student myself, I've experienced how difficult it is to find relevant opportunities. Students spend hours scrolling through job boards that aren't tailored to their skills or interests. Meanwhile, companies struggle to reach the right student candidates.

The current solutions are either too generic (LinkedIn, Indeed) or too focused on specific schools. There's a gap for a platform that truly understands what students are looking for and matches them intelligently.

## What I'm Building

**For Students**
- Smart matching algorithm that learns from your interests
- Clean, simple profile creation with skills and preferences
- Personalized opportunity recommendations
- Easy application tracking

**For Companies**
- Dashboard to post opportunities and manage applications
- Access to a curated pool of student talent
- Filtering and search tools to find the right candidates
- Analytics on application performance

## The Process

Started by interviewing fellow students about their job search struggles. Built a simple MVP to test the core matching concept. Currently iterating based on user feedback and adding features one at a time.

Learning to balance what's technically interesting to build versus what users actually need. Focusing on shipping fast and getting real feedback rather than building in isolation.

## Key Takeaways

- **Product prioritization** - Learning to say no to features and focus on core value
- **User research** - Talking to users early and often changes everything
- **Full-stack development** - Building both frontend and backend from scratch
- **Iterative development** - Ship small, get feedback, improve, repeat

## Current Status

Active development - building core features and testing with early users. Planning to launch beta version to Ateneo students first before expanding.
