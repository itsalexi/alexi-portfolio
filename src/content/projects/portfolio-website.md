## Overview

Built a modern, interactive portfolio website from scratch to showcase my projects, experience, and skills. The site features smooth animations, responsive design, and a clean, professional aesthetic that makes it easy for recruiters and collaborators to learn about my work.

## The Challenge

As a CS student building my career, I needed a professional online presence that would:

- Stand out from generic portfolio templates
- Showcase my technical skills through the site itself
- Be easy to update with new projects and experiences
- Load fast and work perfectly on all devices
- Make a strong first impression with recruiters

## What I Built

**Interactive Components**
- Smooth page transitions with Framer Motion
- Interactive skill cards with detailed modals
- 3D card effects on project previews
- Animated timeline for experience section

**Content Management**
- Markdown-based project case studies
- JSON-driven experience and talks data
- Easy-to-update content without touching code
- Local admin panel for editing (dev only)

**Technical Features**
- Static site generation for blazing fast performance
- Responsive design that adapts to any screen size
- Optimized images and lazy loading
- SEO-friendly with proper meta tags

## The Process

Started by researching modern portfolio designs and identifying what makes them effective. Chose Next.js 14 for its performance and developer experience, paired with Aceternity UI for beautiful pre-built components.

Built the site iteratively, starting with the hero section and gradually adding more sections. Focused on making each component reusable and maintainable.

## Key Takeaways

- **Framer Motion mastery** - Learned how to create complex, performant animations
- **Next.js App Router** - Understood the new paradigm and how to leverage SSG
- **Component architecture** - Built a scalable system that's easy to extend
- **Performance optimization** - Achieved 95+ Lighthouse scores across the board

## Impact

Created a professional online presence that effectively showcases my work and skills. The site has helped me land interviews and makes it easy to share my portfolio with potential employers and collaborators.
