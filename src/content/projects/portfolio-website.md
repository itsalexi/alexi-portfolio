#### **The Gist**

This site has been through a few major phases. Looking back at the old versions is a cool way to see how my style and skills have changed over time. Each one was a snapshot of where I was in my journey as a developer.

#### **Version 1.0: The Lofi Era (3-4 Years Ago)**

My first portfolio was all about the vibe. I was really into lofi aesthetics, so I designed a page with a moody, illustrated forest scene that felt calm and atmospheric. It was less of a resume and more of a personal passion project.

To be honest, this version had the most raw personality. It was a direct reflection of my tastes at the time and wasn't trying to be anything other than a cool space on the internet. While it was creative, it wasn't the most practical for showcasing a growing list of projects.

#### **Version 2.0: The Professional Pivot (Last Year)**

For the next version, I made a hard pivot toward something more professional. I wanted a site that screamed "developer," so I went with a clean, structured look. It had the classic dark, grid background and a card based layout that kept everything neat.

This design was way more functional and did a much better job of presenting my work clearly. But in the process, it lost that personal touch that made the first one special. It was effective, but it felt a little generic.

#### **Version 3.0: Finding the Balance (Today)**

That brings us here. This current site is my effort to blend the unique personality of the first version with the clean functionality of the second. The goal was to build something sleek and modern that still felt like me.

I focused on a minimal design with strong typography and a refined color palette to let the work speak for itself. It’s direct, confident, and feels like the right balance between expressing my style and showcasing my skills.

Each iteration was a learning process. It's been a journey of figuring out not just how to build things, but how to best tell my own story online.
