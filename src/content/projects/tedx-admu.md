#### **The Gist**

I worked with a small team to build the official website for TEDxAteneoDeManilaU 2025. Our main goal was to create a site that was easy to use, looked great, and captured the exciting feel of the event. It was a fantastic project that pushed us to deliver a really polished final product.

#### **The Goal**

A TEDx website has to do a couple of things really well. It needs to get people excited for the event, but it also has to be super clear with all the important info, like who's speaking, the schedule, and how to get tickets. We wanted to build something that felt as professional and cool as the event itself, and that meant creating a seamless online experience for every visitor.

#### **Our Approach**

JJ, Carl, and I teamed up to create a dynamic, user-friendly platform designed to showcase the event and provide a seamless experience for all visitors. As a team of three, we collaborated on everything, but my main focus was on helping to lead the technical development.

We focused on ensuring the website was visually striking, intuitive to navigate, and optimized for performance. This meant:
*   Turning the design mockups into real, interactive components.
*   Making sure the navigation was simple and that finding information felt effortless.
*   Keeping a close eye on performance, optimizing images and code so the site would load quickly for everyone.

It was a very collaborative process. We were constantly sharing ideas and reviewing each other's work to make sure we were all on the same page and building the best site we could.

#### **The Result**

In the end, we launched a site we were all really proud of. It successfully served as the main hub for the event, providing all the necessary information in a clean and engaging way. It’s been a fun and challenging journey, and we’re thrilled with how it all came together.
