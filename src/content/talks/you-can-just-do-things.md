I recently had the incredible opportunity to give my first-ever talk to the Ateneo Junior High School students as a guest of the Ateneo Computer Club. A huge thank you to Niq Suguitan and the entire club for the warm invitation and for trusting me with their stage.

The core idea I wanted to share was simple:

> **You can just do things.**

I spoke about what I call **"human agency"**, the simple but powerful idea that you don't have to wait until you feel perfectly "ready" to start building things that matter. So often, we get caught up in the lie of being ready, waiting for the right skills, the right moment, or the right invitation. But the truth is, you can start now.

Everything begins with a small spark. It could be fixing a tiny annoyance that bothers you every day, or it could be an idea for a bigger tool, like the QPI Calculator I built. The scale doesn't matter. What matters is taking that first step and deciding to act on an idea.

It was an amazing experience connecting with the students, and their energy was fantastic. I'm really excited to do more talks like this in the future and am always open to new invites!
