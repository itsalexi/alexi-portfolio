> Ever tried to teach half a semester's worth of Python in just an hour and a half?

Last October 28, my friend Edward Joshua Diesta and I had the wild idea to do just that. We hosted a Python Workshop for MISA, where we walked a room full of students through the absolute basics of programming. The goal was ambitious: to get everyone from **zero to building a functioning QPI Calculator** by the end of the session.

Cramming weeks of lessons into one short workshop was definitely a challenge. We covered variables, loops, and functions at lightning speed. But the real magic happened when it was time to put it all together.

Seeing everyone's code come to life, and the genuine excitement in their reactions when their calculators actually worked, made the entire effort worth it. Those "aha!" moments are what teaching is all about.

A huge thank you to everyone who joined us and to **MISA eServices** for making this event happen. It was an incredibly fun and rewarding experience to share our passion for coding with a new group of aspiring builders.
